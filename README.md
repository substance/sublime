Substance Sublime
=================


This custom Sublime integration helps us to deal with our many modules.
It has a very simple git status panel which makes it easier to commit and push.
Although, being open-source it is probably generally interesting, as it depends on our custom project
configuration files.

How to install
--------------

Go into the Sublime Application folder (location depends on operating system).

MacOSX:

  cd $HOME/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text2/Packages
  git clone https://github.com/substance/sublime.git Substance
